# syntheticData
Generating Synthetic Data from five different datasets using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks. 


The dataset used are:

1. **Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset**: The dataset contains information about default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005. The label class is called *Default payment* and it indicates if the next month the payment will be carried out or not (1 or 0).

2. **Tokyo Earthquake Dataset**: This dataset collects demographic data from earthquakes in Tokyo between 2013 and 2015. Each one of the instances is made up of seismic indicators and a label, the label for every event is defined as a logical value (1 or 0): one if the maximum magnitude for events is larger than a predefined threshold (in this case 5) or zero otherwise. 
  
3. **Electrical Grid Stability Simulated Data Data Set**: one of the milestones of electricity companies is to predict electricity demand from variables such as price for stable electricity grids. One of the newest techniques is the Decentral Smart Grid Control (DSGC) based on mathematical equations with input values. This data set collects a simulation of these input values and indicates through a label whether the power grid will be stable or not. 
    
4. **Pima Indians Diabetes Database**: The objective of the dataset is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on medical diagnostic measurements. The dataset consists on several medical predictor variables and one target variable named *Outcome*.
    
5. **Wine Quality Dataset**: Data related to red and white variantes of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. This data set contains chemical data that defines the quality of the sample using a numerical scale. For this study, a threshold of five has been chosen to define whether the wine is of quality or not, thus having a binary label, i.e., one means high quality, zero means poor quality.
